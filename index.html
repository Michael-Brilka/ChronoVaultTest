            Reliving past events is a crucial aspect of visual research, enabling deeper insights into both the sequence and context of actions. Ideally, a continuous recording would ensure that no moment is lost; however, this approach quickly becomes impractical due to the immense effort required to review and analyze large amounts of footage. 
To address this challenge, prior work has introduced devices equipped with sensors and cameras that automatically trigger recordings when predefined conditions are met. While this selective recording approach reduces unnecessary footage, it is limited to capturing only the present and lacks retrospective context, which is essential for analyzing complex scenarios.
We introduce ChronoVault, an open-source framework designed for simple setup, configuration, and recording of retrospective videos. ChronoVault continuously monitors hardware- and software-signals, buffering a video-stream and saving said buffer, when specific conditions are detected. The system is built on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2, which supports camera integration and connectivity with peripheral devices.
To evaluate ChronoVault we performed a user study. In it, participants were tasked to build a model out of building blocks and document the ends of certain subassembly tasks. Compared to an external reference camera, we reduce the footage amount, while retaining all relevant events.

				<h2 class="title is-3">The Video Capture System</h2> <div class="content has-text-justified"> 
					<p> 
					
					The video capture system is built around the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, chosen for its ability to encode 1080p video at 30 fps. Since it lacks a real-time clock, an external RTC module was added for reliable timestamping. Video transfers are handled wirelessly via SSH over a self-hosted Wi-Fi hotspot, activated by a hardware switch that toggles between recording and transfer modes. The camera connects via CSI, using the official Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera with support for interchangeable lenses. To provide user feedback and detect system errors (e.g., Picamera2 crashes), an LED indicates active recording status. The system leaves 23 GPIO pins free for expansion and is powered by a Li-Po battery with direct voltage supply and a basic charging board, all controlled through a physical power switch. </br>

				<h2 class="title is-3">The Software</h2> <div class="content has-text-justified"> 
					<p> 
					
					The software is built on the Picamera2 Python package and extended with a lightweight, modular framework for easy deployment and customization. It consists of three core components:</br>

    Settings: Configurations are defined in a YAML file loaded at startup, specifying parameters like output paths, camera settings, and device IDs—allowing centralized, scalable control across devices.</br>

    Record: Video capture uses Picamera2’s CircularOutput to buffer recent footage in RAM. When triggered, buffered frames are saved and optionally extended by a configurable duration before being written as H.264 files.</br>

    Save-Event: Triggers the recording process via software or hardware. Software triggers use a blocking queue; hardware triggers rely on GPIO edge detection via the rpi-lgpio library. Multiple triggers can run in parallel.</br>

This structure provides researchers with a flexible and efficient recording solution that’s easy to configure and deploy, while still supporting complex use cases. </br>

				<h2 class="title is-3">Survey</h2> <div class="content has-text-justified"> 
					<p> 
					To assess the functionality of our platform and highlight its advantages in both data capture and post-analysis, we conducted a user study.
					In the user study, participants were asked to assemble a small flower modelusing building blocks.
					The experiment involved comparing footage recorded by ChronoVault with that from an external reference camera, alongside collecting qualitative participant feedback on their experience using the system.
					After the experiment, participants completed a 33-question survey covering demographics, technology use, usability (SUS), trust (TIAS), and custom questions about their experience with ChronoVault.

The System Usability Scale (SUS) yielded an average score of 77.5, with a Cronbach’s Alpha of 0.791, indicating good usability and internal consistency. The Trust in Automation Scale (TIAS) averaged 4.9, with a Cronbach’s Alpha of 0.782, suggesting participants found the system trustworthy.

Custom feedback showed that most participants found video recording straightforward, though one participant struggled—suggesting room for improved guidance. About 83% reported that the device did not interfere with their manual task. Opinions were mixed on who should control the recording and whether automatic, body-based triggers would be preferable.

Some uncertainty was noted regarding input recognition, with five participants unsure whether their recording attempts were successful. This indicates a potential need for clearer feedback, such as haptic indicators. Nonetheless, most participants felt in control of the device.

In summary, users rated ChronoVault as easy to use, trustworthy, and reliable, and most expressed a willingness to use it again.
